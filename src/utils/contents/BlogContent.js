Instead, practice self-compassion and acknowledge that everyone procrastinates from time to time. Use Positive Reinforcement: Reward yourself when you complete tasks or meet milestones. This can help reinforce productive behavior. Accountability Partners: Partnering with a friend or classmate can provide mutual accountability and motivation to stay on track.Seek Help: If you're consistently struggling with procrastination, consider reaching out to a counselor or academic advisor for guidance."`,
